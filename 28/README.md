# Number Spiral Diagonals
## Problem 27
Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

_21_ 22 23 24 _25_
20  _7_  8  _9_ 10
19  6  _1_  2 11
18  _5_  4  _3_ 12
_17_ 16 15 14 _13_

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
